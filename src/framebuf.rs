//! A RAM-backed `Rgb565` framebuffer for a single rectangular region.
//!
//! embedded-graphics primitives are rendered into a plain pixel `Vec` (no SPI
//! traffic), then the whole region is pushed to the panel in one
//! [`DrawTarget::fill_contiguous`] call — a single address-window command plus
//! one streamed pixel payload — instead of one SPI transaction per primitive.
//!
//! This is what lets the clock box repaint every second: the seven-segment
//! [`crate::segdisplay`] logic issues a `Rectangle::draw` per lit segment, and
//! against the live display each of those was its own address-window + transfer.
//! Batching them behind this buffer collapses a frame down to one transfer, and
//! the atomic flush also removes the clear-then-redraw flicker.
